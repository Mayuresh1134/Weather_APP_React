# Weather_APP_React

## Overview

This is a basic weather app built using React that provides weather updates based on the user's input location (city). The app fetches weather data from an external API and displays the current temperature, weather condition, humidity, and wind speed for the specified city.

## Features

- User-friendly interface for entering the city name.
- Real-time weather updates based on the entered city.
- Display of temperature in Celsius units based on user preference.
- Clear and visually appealing design.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** The frontend of the app is built using React, allowing for a dynamic and interactive user interface.
- **Axios:** Used for making API requests to fetch weather data from an external weather API.
- **CSS3:** Used for styling the app to make it visually appealing and user-friendly.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project directory in your code editor.
3. Install the required dependencies using `npm install` command.
4. Obtain a free API key from a weather API provider (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).
5. Append the key in url variable in APP.js
6. Save the file and start the app using `npm start` command.
7. The app will open in your default browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
8. Enter the name of the city in the input field and press Enter.
9. The app will fetch weather data for the specified city and display the weather updates on the screen.

## How It Works

1. When the user enters the city name in the input field and presses Enter, the `WeatherApp` component is triggered.
2. The component makes an API request to the weather API provider using Axios, passing the city name and API key as parameters.
3. The API returns the weather data for the specified city, which is then displayed on the screen.
4. The user can change the temperature unit from Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa by clicking on a toggle button.

## Future Enhancements

- Add support for more weather data, such as weather forecast for the next few days.
- Implement geolocation to automatically detect the user's current location and provide weather updates without the need for manual input.
- Improve the design and add more user-friendly features, such as a search autocomplete for city names.

## Conclusion

This basic React weather app serves as a starting point for understanding React components, API integration, and basic data handling in a React application. With further enhancements, it can be developed into a full-fledged weather app with additional features and improved user experience.
